Hi! I'm Lijie Wang, you can call me Jack Wang. I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Robotics Engineering** at **Chu Kochen Honors College**, **Zhejiang University**. My research interests lie in robot mapping, intelligent perception, and autonomous navigation. I have been admitted to the <a href='http://zju-fast.com/'>FAST Lab<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a> at Zhejiang University as a master’s student, starting in September 2025, under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4RObDv0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate'>Pro. Fei Gao<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>

During my undergraduate years, I actively participate in research and competitions, closely collaborating with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tpOOC4zBfZ8C&hl=en'>Pro. Yu Zhang<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1hI9bqUAAAAJ'>Pro. Rong Xiong<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>, and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N543LSoAAAAJ&hl=en'>Pro. Yue Wang<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>. In competitions, I'm now the team leader of <a href='https://github.com/ZJUNlict'>ZJUNlict<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>, Zhejiang University's team in the <a href='https://ssl.robocup.org/'>RoboCup Soccer Small Size League (SSL)<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>. As a core member, I have led the team to achieve multiple awards.
